### This is my repository of algorithms studies

- This is a repository to store algorithms that I am studying, for the purpose of reviewing and remembering this study.
- It is public so if you want to use it to study too, feel free.
- Studying and understanding algorithms is a bit boring, but very important to learn, to understand how abstractions and programming languages work.
- Much of what we use in our daily lives in computers has algorithms involved in it's operation.
- And here each algorithm presented will have an explanation of how it works and where it can be applied.

Use this material to learn, having a skill like this can be useful one day.
